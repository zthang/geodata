This longstanding geologic process has likely influenced the evolution of life on different time scales through a myriad of feedbacks between the formation and erosion of land masses, oceanic circulation and climate, and the diversification and extinction of species. Here, we synthesize recent advances in our understanding of the linkages between plate tectonics, climate and biodiversity, with an emphasis on emerging insights into how ecological interactions within and across major biomes may shape the evolutionary trajectory of life on earth. At the margins of continents, the shifting tectonic plates, transport nutrients through upwelling currents from the deep ocean to the surface, which potentially enhances primary productivity and supports diverse food webs. Our review highlights the importance of further investigating how complex ecological feedbacks between the oceanic and terrestrial realms are modulating the influence of plate tectonics on the fate of species and ecosystems in a rapidly changing world.\"\nThought: Plate tectonics has influenced the Earth's environment, leading to changes in climate and ocean circulation, which have in turn impacted the evolution of life in different ways.\nFinal Answer: Plate tectonics has influenced the evolution of life on Earth through its impact on environmental conditions such as ocean circulation, climate, and nutrient availability.\n",

Some of the major types of faults include normal faults, reverse faults, and strike-slip faults. Normal faults are caused by tensional forces and typically result in the hanging wall moving down relative to the footwall. Reverse faults result from compressional forces and have the opposite sense of motion, with the hanging wall moving up relative to the footwall. Strike-slip faults are caused by shear forces and result in horizontal movement along the fault plane with no vertical motion.\"\nThought:  Geologists classify faults based on their relative motion and geometry, with major types including normal, reverse, and strike-slip faults. \nFinal Answer: Geologists classify faults into major types such as normal, reverse, and strike-slip faults based on how rock layers move relative to each other.\n",

You have access to the following tools (Only use these tools we provide you):\n\nGeo_search: \"Perform Geoscience paper Search on AceMap Search engine.\nUse search_geoscience_paper(input: str, page: int) to get search results according to the input string and page index (index begin from 1).\n\ncode_interpreter: Plugin for executing python codes.\nUse execute_code(code: str) to execute Python expressions with Python Interpreter.\nSome available functions are:\nUse get_poi(name:str) to get the latitude and longitude of a Point of Interest (POI).\nUse get_poi_bing(name:str, api_key:str) to get the latitude and longitude of a Point of Interest (POI) by using your api_key of Bing maps. \nUse cal_dist(poi_a:tuple[float, float], poi_b:tuple[float, float]) to calculate the geodesic distance(km) from POI a to POI b.\nUse get_rev_poi(poi:tuple[float, float]) to get the address corresponding to the latitude and longitude of a POI.\n\nUse the following format:\n\nQuestion: the input question you must answer\nThought: you should always think about what to do\nAction: the action to take, should be one of [search_geoscience_paper, execute_code]\nAction Input: the input to the action\nObservation: the result of the action\n... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)\nThought: I now know the final answer\nFinal Answer: the final answer to the original input question\n\nQuestion: How do we mitigate the impact of sea level rise?\nThought: I need to search for information on how the impact of sea level rise is mitigated.\nAction: search_geoscience_paper\nAction Input: {\"input\": \"mitigating impact of sea level rise\", \"page\": 1}.\nObservation: \"mitigating impact of sea level rise\"\nThought:  I have arrived at the concluding response and I am well-informed of the final answer. \nFinal Answer: Mitigating the impacts of sea level rise involves a variety of strategies, including coastal protection and restoration, land-use planning, and adaptation measures. This requires the cooperation and coordination of government agencies, private organizations, and individuals to implement effective solutions and reduce the risk of coastal flooding and erosion.\n"]
